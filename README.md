#### Problem Statement: Limited public transportation to the City of New Hamburg

Grand River Transit (GRT) began operating Route 77 on April 25, 2016. The route connects The Boardwalk to Wilmot Township, which includes New Hamburg (Grand River Transit, 2017).
Although this route was implemented it currently has some issues that cause discomfort among residents and/or people interested in visiting the city of New Hamburg, some of these concerns:
- Restricted bus schedule: The 77 bus only operates from 7am to 7pm, which limits travel options for early morning and late evening commuters.
- Single departure point: Commuters must first go to the Boardwalk station, adding extra time and inconvenience.
- Poor route coverage: Many areas lack direct bus access, forcing residents to use multiple modes of transportation (Grand River Transit, n.d.).
- Need for improvement: A more efficient, accessible and expanded transportation solution is needed.
