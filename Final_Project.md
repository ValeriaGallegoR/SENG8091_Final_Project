# EPIC 1: IMPROVED BUS SCHEDULE

**As** a passenger who wants to travel to New Hamburg,

**I want** the 77 bus to operate earlier in the morning and later in the evening,

**To** have the flexibility to travel at any time of day that suits my needs.

### Assumption:

Passengers would use the bus service more frequently if the operating hours were extended. And the highest passenger flow can be early in the morning and late in the evening.

### Validations (Questions):

- What specific early morning and late evening time slots do passengers prefer?
- How many passengers currently avoid the bus due to its limited hours?
- Would extended hours attract new users or just better serve existing ones?
- How much additional cost would extend service hours introduce, and is it justifiable by projected usage?
- GRT has previously tried to extend schedules? what was the result?
